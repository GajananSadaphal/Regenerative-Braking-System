# Regenerative Braking System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the **conceptual design and working principle of a Regenerative Braking System**, developed during my first year of engineering.  
The system focuses on recovering kinetic energy during braking and converting it into electrical energy instead of wasting it as heat.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- To understand the working principle of regenerative braking
- To capture and store energy generated during braking
- To improve overall energy efficiency in electric vehicles

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle
When the brake is applied, the motor operates as a generator.  
The rotational kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy, which is then:
- Stored in a battery / capacitor  
- Used to power auxiliary loads or reused later  

This process improves efficiency and reduces energy loss.
